<h1>Online Update</h1>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> comes with an Online Update functionality. As there is no special notification, you will
need to trigger it manually. The system will check the Update Site whether there is a new version available
and ask you to confirm the update. The application will restart when the update was installed.</p>
<p>You can check the availability of an update also by going to the 
<a href="http://techblog.ralph-schuster.eu/rsbudget/"><em>RsBudget</em> Homepage</a>.</p>
<p><b>Important!</b> If you sit behind a proxy then it might be required to adjust the
