<h1>Account Settings</h1>
<p style="float:clear;">This tab lists the bank accounts for your <em>RsBudget</em> installation. You 
can create, modify and change accounts.</p>
<p>Accounts currently have no further meaning. However, each transaction record needs to be attached 
to a bank account to enable future enhancements, e.g. HBCI downloads from your bank.</p>

<h2 id="create">Create a new Account</h2>
<p>Click the "Create Account" link. This will create and select a new record. Please refer to the 
<a href="#change">Change Account</a> section to fill the form.</p>

<table>

<tr>
	<td>Default</td>
	<td>This flag marks the account as the default account. <em>RsBudget</em> will automatically attach 
	    all transactions with this account. However, you can select the account for each individual transaction.</td>

	<td>The account will be included in the plan calculations. Remove the flag when this account

</table>

<h2 id="delete">Delete an Account</h2>
<p>Click the "Delete Account" link. <em>RsBudget</em> will ask you for confirmation and then remove the account
from the list. However, the account is not physically deleted but marked as inactive only. You can revert your
action when you cancel the Preferences dialog. Once you confirmed all changes with "OK", the deactivation will
be performed and there is currently no possibility to re-enable the account (Future Enhancement).</p>
