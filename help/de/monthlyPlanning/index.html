<h1>Expense Tracking</h1>
<p>You are ready to track and control your expenses as soon as you <a href="../generalPlanning/index.html">created your
budget plan</a>. Tracking is what you will do most of the time. Entering new transactions, changing planned amounts and
controlling your financial activities.</p> 
<p>You can change any transaction or budget without affecting other months or the template. The changes are kept
within the respective month only. This article explains how to properly track your expenses.</p>

<p><a href="../views/monthly-planning.html">A complete description of the view can be found here.</a></p>

<h2 id="createplan">Creating the plan</h2>
<p>Navigate to the respective month (the current month is opened by default when you start <em>RsBudget</em>). Create the plan
by using the <img src="../../images/money--plus.png"/> button from the toolbar. This action will evaluate your 
<a href="../generalPlanning/index.html">General Budget Plan</a> and create all transactions and budgets that are planned
for the given month. The <a href="../views/monthly-planning.html#summary">Summary Section</a> will now tell you
the basic figures if your actual transactions will occur as planned.</p>

<h2 id="setopeningstatus">Opening the month</h2>
<p>The next step is to tell <em>RsBudget</em> what the opening status of your accounts was. This value is defined individually
for each month. So it is not required that is equal to the closing status of the previous months. However, it is recommended
to have them aligned. The opening status is also the value that occurs in the <a href="../views/history.html">History View</a>.</p>

<p>You set the status by clicking the <img src="../../images/book-brown.png"/> button from the the view's toolbar. The 
dialog that appears will evaluate all possible options and propose a few possible amounts. You either select one of them
or enter the amount manually. Please make sure that you entered the amount of the <b>left</b> side of the dialog, as the
right side is reserved for the closing status.</p>

<h2 id="tracking">Tracking actual transactions</h2>
<p>You can now start tracking income and expenses. Create transactions or budgets, enter actual amounts and their transaction
dates throughout the month. The system will reflect your changes in the Summary Section and recalculate Profit/Loss values
according to existing and remaining transactions. Details about the various actions are described in the 
<a href="../views/monthly-planning.html#tasks">view's help page</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to simplify the assignment of categories and budgets by using respective rules. Please refer to the
<a href="../settings/rules.html">Preferences Dialog</a> description for further information.</p> 

<h2 id="closing">Closing the month</h2>
<p>Finally, you will close your month financially when the last transaction has been entered. The last step is therefore
to define the closing status of your accounts. This value defines the Profit/Loss of the month. It is saved separately
so there is actually no requirement that it fits logically to your transactions of the month. But it makes more
sense to take over the proposal from <em>RsBudget</em> when assigning the closing status. click the 
<img src="../../images/book-brown.png"/> button again and set the value at the <b>right</b> side of the dialog.</p>

<p>That's it. You successfully tracked and controlled your finances of this month and can start over again with the
next month.</p>
