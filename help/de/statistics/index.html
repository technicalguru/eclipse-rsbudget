<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> keeps all data in a database which allows later statistical analysis and historical research.
The current version does not yet include statistical analysis but provides a simple historical overview of your
financial status. The <a href="../views/history.html">History View</a> contains the status as of the 1st of each
month of your planning. Additional values can be stored separately such as your car mileage or the value of your 
shares.</p>
<p>These additional values must be defined within the <a href="../settings/history.html">Preference Dialog</a>.
The view will list all your important data per month. Monetary values will also list the difference from
the previous month. Custom values have this difference listed only when defined in the 
<a href="../settings/history.html">Preference Dialog</a>.</p>
