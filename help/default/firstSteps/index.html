<h1>First Steps</h1>

<a name="ui"/><h2>The User Interface</h2>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> is based on Eclipse RCP which delivers a few very user-friendly features. The window is split into two parts.
The main area contains your <a href="../views/general-planning.html">General</a> and <a href="../views/monthly-planning.html">Monthly Budget Planning</a>. 
It also shows the <a href="../views/statistics.html">statistics</a> of your financial records. 
All three features are separated by a "Tabbed" Panel. Select each individual "Tab" by clicking onto the title of it.</p>
<p>At the right you will find additional views, such as the list of <a href="../views/categories.html">Categories</a>, a 
<a href="../views/details.html">Details view</a> and an area where you can note down <a href="../views/remarks.html">remarks</a> for
the planning of the respective month. The size each of these views 
occupies can be changed by dragging the border into the respective direction. Click on view's border with your mouse, 
keep the mouse button down and move it. Release the mouse button when the border is at the position you desire. <em>RsBudget</em> 
will remember your decision and position the view accordingly next time you open it.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is that you can drag areas onto other Tab Panes. Imagine you want the Details panel to be at the right
bottom of the window and not at the right top where it is currently. Click on the title and keep the mouse button down while
you move the mouse to the position where you want the view to be positioned. Red lines will appear to show where the view would
land when you release the mouse button. You can even "detach" a view from the window. Just drag the view as described above outside
of window.</p>
<p>All changes can be reverted when you open the <a href="../settings/index.html">Preferences Dialog</a> and tick the "Reset window 
layout on next start" box. <em>RsBudget</em> will reset all your changes when you open it next.</p>
<p>Each Tab has a Toolbar that appears right to its title when the tab is shown. This Toolbar contains buttons which trigger insert
or delete actions, sort table rows or other actions available to the respective tab. A Toolbar button is dimmed (disabled) when
the action is not available at the moment. E.g. the Delete button will be disabled when you did not select any row to be deleted.</p>
<p>The main window also has a menu and the global toolbar where the most important actions can be triggered from. Here you 
can exit <em>RsBudget</em> or open the <a href="../settings/index.html">Preferences Dialog</a>. The Help menu offers you access to 
documentation and program updates.</p>

<h2>How to Start</h2>

<a name="step1"/>
<h3>Step 1 - Define Categories</h3>
<p>The first thing you should start with is the list of <a href="../views/categories.html">Categories</a>. You will find it at the top-right
of the window. At the beginning, it only contains one single category. It is the one that you defined when you configured <em>RsBudget</em>.
Categories are used to cluster your financial transactions. They serve as containers to collect transactions belonging together
logically. Typical categories are "Food", "Energy Costs" or "Insurances". Later, you will be able to see 
<a href="../views/statistics.html">statistics</a> which tell you totals of this category in a certain period or trends over time.</p>
<p>It is not required to have many categories. You can change them at any time. However, the more financial records you stored within
<em>RsBudget</em> the more effort you will have to spend in order to assign them to a new category. So you should have at least a
minimum set that is reasonable to you.</p>
<p>In order to create a new category, select the <a href="../views/categories.html">Categories</a> view and either press the 
<code>Insert</code> key or the 
<img src="../../images/table-insert-row.png"/> button. A new line will appear at the end of the list. Double-click the name of the 
new row and enter the title. Hit <code>Enter</code> when you are done.</p>
<p>One of the categories is markes as the default one. All transactions not belonging into any other category will automatically be
assigned to this one.</p>
<p>There is also a simple "Rules Engine" which helps you to automatically assign a category while you enter a new transaction. More 
details can be found in the <a href="../settings/rules.html#categories">Preferences Dialog</a>.</p>

<a name="step2"/>
<h3>Step 2 - Create a General Plan</h3>
<p>You will also need a General Plan that describes how each month in your financial planning looks like. Select the 
<a href="../views/general-planning.html">General Planning</a> view and start inserting transactions. You create new transactions as
you did before for categories. Hit <code>Insert</code> or the click the <img src="../../images/table-insert-row.png"/> button.</p>
<p>The General Plan is a template only. It does not reflect real transactions yet. The General Plan serves you to plan your finances.
Create transactions to plan for monthly rent, insurance expenses, salary income and whatever can be foreseen to happen in a
month.</p>
<p>There will be transactions that do not occur every month but every two, three or even twelve months. The Cycle and Occurrance
columns can be changed to reflect this behaviour.</p>
<p>Finally, you can transform some transactions into <em>Budgets</em>. This means they will be virtual wallets that real transactions
are assigned to and will reduce.</p>

<a name="step3"/>
<h3>Step 3 - Create a Monthly Plan</h3>
<p>The General Plan is a blueprint for a real plan of a specific month. Select the <a href="../views/monthly-planning.html">Monthly Planning</a>
tab, select the correct month (current month is already pre-selected) and click on the <img src="../../images/money--plus.png"/> button.
This will create the Monthly Plan according to the General Plan that you created earlier.</p>
<p>The Monthly Plan now contains all transactions that are planned. The "Planned Amount" column contains the values that you entered
earlier in the General Plan. An additional column, "Actual Amount" will receive the actual numbers that occurred. The first column, 
"Transaction Date", will be set when a transaction really takes place.</p>
<p>You can add or remove transactions or budgets. Simply press <code>Insert</code> key or click the  <img src="../../images/table-insert-row.png"/> button.

<a name="step4"/>
<h3>Step 4 - Tracking Expenses</h3>
<p>To enter a real transaction, search for the correct row in the plan and double-click the "Actual Amount" field of that row. Enter
the amount that the transaction is about. Expenses must be signed (with "-" sign), incomes can be entered as is. Finish your input
by hitting the <code>Enter</code> key. <em>RsBudget</em> now automatically sets the "Transaction Date" of that row.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can double-click the "Transaction Date" column and enter the date when the transactions occurred. <em>RsBudget</em>
will set the "Actual Amount" to the value that the "Planned Amount" listed. Regardless which way you choose, all values can be
edited at each time by simply double-clicking the respective field.</p>
<p>If an unplanned transaction appears on your bank account, you can add a new row into your Monthly Plan by either pressing the
<code>Insert</code> key or clicking the <img src="../../images/table-insert-row.png"/> button. Transactions that are not valid
anymore can be removed by selecting them and pressing the <code>Delete</code> key or clicking the
<img src="../../images/table-delete-row.png"/> button. The same way you can remove an actual transaction so that the planned
transactions remains.</p>
<p>All changes that you perform within the table are saved immediately to your database. There is no need to explicitly save
anything. Furthermore, the values at the top of the view will be updated according to your changes. They tell you what your
planned and actual expenses were and what the forecast will be at the end of the month.</p>

<a name="step5"/>
<h3>Step 5 - Feeding the Statistics</h3>
<p>A few values need to be set explicitly for the history and statistics. The Account Balance at the beginning and the end of 
the month is such a value. Click the <img src="../../images/wallet.png"/> button and enter your values. The dialog suggests
a few options which make it easier for you to define the correct value.</p>
