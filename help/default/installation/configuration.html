<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>The configuration will start when you first start <em>RsBudget</em>. Just double-click on the executable
that you will find in the extracted folder.</p>

<p>The program will ask first which language you want to use for setup. Select your language and click
OK to start the configuration. You should see a Welcome Screen in your chosen language.</p>

<p>Click "Next" to see the Database Configuration Page.</p>

<h2 id="dbsetup">Database Configuration</h2>
<p><a href="../../images/en/setup-database.png"><img class="screenshot" border="no" src="../../images/en/setup-database.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> stores all your data in a database. The choice which database it uses is on you. This page
asks you for details, especially which database product you chose and the access information (login, password)
to it.</p>

<p>An important question is the "Use Full Encryption" checkbox. Full encryption means that <b>all</b> your data in the
database will be encrypted so that other users of your computer cannot read it even though they get access to your
database. You should keep in mind that this setting cannot be changed once the configuration completed.</p>

<p>Full encryption uses your application password (see next section) to encrypt and decrypt the data. As your
application password is not stored anywhere, losing your password means that you lose all your data. So consider
carefully whether you want switch on full encryption.</p>

<p>Click the "Test Connection" button to check whether your setting are correct. The program will inform you
about any existing data and mismatches in your database settings.</p>

<p>Click "Next" to assign your application password. If you didn't test the database connection yet manually,
the program will do so now and will not proceed if it detects any misconfiguration.</p>

<h2 id="password">Setting an Application Password</h2>
<p><a href="../../images/en/setup-password.png"><img class="screenshot" border="no" src="../../images/en/setup-password.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>The application password protects your data from any unauthorized users. It is not stored anywhere on your
computer so you don't need to be afraid that anyone can ever steal it by stealing your computer or scanning
your disk.</p>

<p>The program will ask you first each time it starts up to make sure that no unauthorized persons access your data.
However, professional attackers could either see your data directly in the database (if you didn't select full
encryption) or grab your password by spy software when you are typing it in. There is no 100 percent safety. ;-)</p>

<p>Type in your password twice so <em>RsBudget</em> can be sure that you entered the password correctly.</p>

<p>Click "Next" to setup your default bank account.</p>

<h2 id="account">Default Bank Account</h2>
<p><a href="../../images/en/setup-account.png"><img class="screenshot" border="no" src="../../images/en/setup-account.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> requires each transaction to be connected with a bank account. This can either be your
real bank account or any "virtual" that you make up for the program. There is currently no further meaning
of that bank account. However, future extensions will be made available which can download transactions
automatically from your bank so you save typing effort.</p>

<p>The Bank selection is currently based on German banks only. If you don't have a German bank account, just select
any bank randomly and continue. As mentioned before, there is currently no further action behind this setting.
A future update could enhance this to care for others than German banks.</p>

<p>Enter the name that you want to refer to for your account and the account number and owner as known by the bank.</p>

<p>Click "Next" to setup the default transaction category.</p>
 
<h2 id="category">Default Transaction Category</h2>
<p><a href="../../images/en/setup-category.png"><img class="screenshot" border="no" src="../../images/en/setup-category.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>Each transaction is associated with a category. You will be able to create your own categories later in the
program. However, at the beginning at least one category is required that all transactions are assigned to by
default. <em>RsBudget</em> proposes "Misc" as the name for it, but you can change it to whatever you feel
appropriate.</p>

<p>Click "Next" to review your settings.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Setup Summary</h2>
<p><a href="../../images/en/setup-summary.png"><img class="screenshot" border="no" src="../../images/en/setup-summary.png" width="400"/></a></p>
<p>The last screen shows again all settings that you have done in the previous screens. Review them
carefully and press "Finish" to confirm them. Otherwise, click "Back" to go back to the setting page
that you need to change.</p>

<p><em>RsBudget</em> will now create all required database tables and initial data and, if successful, start
up with the main screen. Congratulation! Your installation is ready to use.</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="../introduction/index.html">Introduction</a> page to learn the philosophy of how 
<em>RsBudget</em> manages and logs your transactions. The <a href="../firstSteps/index.html">First Steps</a>
help page will show you how to begin and how to plan and manage your first budgets.</p>
