<h1>Software Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Before you can install <em>RsBudget</em>, you will need to install additional software on your computer. This chapter guides 
you through the process of preparing your computer.</p>

<a name="jre"></a>
<h2>Java Runtime Environment</h2>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> is based on Eclipse' Rich Client Platform (RCP) which is fully based on Java. However, Java is not part of the 
<em>RsBudget</em> installation package. That's why you will need a current Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Please, download
and install at least a JRE 7 on your computer. <em>RsBudget</em> was developed and tested with <a href="http://java.oracle.com/">Oracle's JRE</a>, 
so it is recommended to use their product. Follow the instructions of your product choice to install the JRE.</p>

<a name="database"></a>
<h2>Database Software</h2>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> saves all your information in SQL based database engine. Here is a list of choices.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#hsqldb">HyperSQL</a> (HSQLDB) - no further installation required</li>
<li><a href="#mysql">MySQL 5.x</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html">Oracle</a> - generally supported but not tested (see <a href="#other">Other Databases</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">DB2</a> - generally supported but not tested (see <a href="#other">Other Databases</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no additional installation required if you opt for HyperSQL. The required software is packaged along
with <em>RsBudget</em>.</p>

<a name="hsqldb"></a>
<h3>Using HyperSQL</h3>
<p>There are no additional steps to perform for <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HyperSQL</a>. The software is already packaged with <em>RsBudget</em>.
This choice is 2nd best only as HyperSQL is not tested thoroughly enough with <em>RsBudget</em>.</p>

<a name="mysql"></a>
<h3>Using MySQL</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/community/">MySQL 5.x</a> shall be used only when you are an expert of this software. 
Install MySQL according to the MySQL installation instructions. Additionally, you will need to perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a database, e.g. <code>rsbudget</code>.</li>
	<li>Create a database user <code>rsbudget</code> (or any other name) and assign an appropriate password to it.</li>
	<li>Grant <b>all</b> privileges on the new database to the new database user. This shall especially include CREATE, ALTER and DROP
	TABLE privileges as well as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE privileges.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember your setup as <em>RsBudget</em> will ask for this information in the initial configuration wizard.</p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h3>Other Databases</h3>
<p>It is generally possible to use any database supporting JDBC and Hibernate. If you choose to use such a database for
your <em>RsBudget</em> installation, you will need to perform additional steps. The current version, however,
does not support them out-of-the-box. Therefore, this is recommended for experts in Java development, only. 
You will need to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Install your database product</li>
	<li>Setup the database user</li>
	<li>Create the database instance that holds <em>RsBudget</em> data</li>
	<li>Create the database tables</li>
	<li>Create initial data</li>
	<li>Create the <code>dbconfig.xml</code> file in your home directory</li>
	<li>Provide the JDBC driver via classpath to <em>RsBudget</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to perform all these tasks is to setup <em>RsBudget</em> for MySQL first and then copy all
database data to your product. Finally, you will need to change the <code>dbconfig.xml</code> file that
<em>RsBudget</em> has created while performing the initial setup in your <code>$HOME/.rsbudget</code>
directory.</p>
<p>A future version of <em>RsBudget</em> will support other database products.</p>
