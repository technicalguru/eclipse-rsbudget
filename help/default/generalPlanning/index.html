<h1>General Budget Planning</h1>
<p>The General Budget Planning defines which transactions and budgets occur each month. You can think of it as a template.
<em>RsBudget</em> uses this template to create specific transactions for a specific month. So this month is an
instance of the template. While tracking your monthly expenses, you work within your 
<a href="../monthlyPlanning/index.html">Monthly Budget Plan</a>.</p>
<p>You can change your template as often as you like. Existing plans for specific months are not affected by these
changes. They will be used only when you create a new plan for a specific month.</p>

<h2 id="createtx">Creating a new transaction</h2>
<p>Press the <code>Insert</code> key in order to create a new row in the table. The system will scroll to the end of
the table and place the editing cursor in the text column. Just start typing the name of your transaction! Press <code>Tab</code> or
double-click the Amount field of the same row in order to enter the amount that you plan for this transaction, e.g. "-10" for
10 Dollars expense, or "10" for 10 Dollars income.</p>
<p>The scenario just described a monthly recurring transaction. That means, <em>RsBudget</em> will insert this transaction in each
new plan it creates for specific months.</p>

<h2 id="changecycle">Changing the recurrence (cycle)</h2>
<p>Some transactions do not occur every month but just once a quarter or year. You can define this behaviour by double-clicking the
"Cycle" column of your transaction.</p>
<p>Transactions that do not occur each month need an additional information: in what months they occur. Depending on the specific cycle,
the options vary. The current selection can be seen in column "Occurrance". Double-click the value in order to change it.</p>

<h2 id="assigncategory">Assigning a category</h2>
<p>New transactions are assigned to the default category. You can change the category by double-clicking the respective column
of your transaction and selecting from the list. (The list itself can be controlled in the <a href="../views/index.html">Categories view</a>).</p>

<h2 id="createbudget">Creating a budget</h2>
<p>A budget in <em>RsBudget</em>'s terminology is a container of multiple transactions. It is used when you cannot tell in advance
how many transactions of this type you will perform in a specific month. "Groceries" is such an example. You go to a grocery store
mutliple time a month, but you do not want to spend more than $100 a month for it. Instead of creating many "potential" transactions
in your template, you will use a budget.</p>
<p>A budget is created by using an existing transaction. So the first step is to create a transaction as described above. Next, you
right-click on the new transaction and the context menu will appear. Select the "Convert to budget" item. <em>RsBudget</em> will
transform the row to a budget and move the row to the top of the list (all budgets are listed first). It will also get a turquoise
background so you can easily distinguish between transactions and budgets.</p>

<h2 id="assignbudget">Assigning a budget</h2>
<p>Although it is not very common that specific transactions within budgets are known up-front, <em>RsBudget</em> let you define
transactions <b>within</b> existing budgets. Double-click on the "Budget" column in your transaction's row and select the budget
that your transaction belongs to.</p>

<h2 id="order">Changing the transaction order</h2>
<p>You can define the order of budgets and transactions in your template by either using the context menu (right-click) or pressing
the <code>Ctrl+Up</code> and <code>Ctrl-Down</code> keys. The order is used when <em>RsBudget</em> creates your monthly plan.</p>

<h2 id="deletetx">Deleting a transaction</h2>
<p>Delete a transaction or budget from your template by selecting the respective row. Then press <code>Delete</code> or click on the
<img src="../../images/table-delete-row.png"/> button. Confirm the the dialog question and the row will disappear.</p>
<p>This action has no effect on existing plans for specific months.</p>
