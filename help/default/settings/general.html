<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>This combo box control which language all texts (and this help) will be displayed with. Although there are currently only
a few languages implemented, you should select your personal language nevertheless. The system will automatically use
English when a text is not available in your language.</p>
<p>The language settings also controls how amounts are displayed. E.g. The US-style of displaying amounts is to prefix the
value with the currency symbol. Negative values appear in brackets, e.g. "(USD2,000.00)". As you can see from the example,
digits are grouped with a comma, the decimal separator is the dot. The German display would be "-2.000,00 EUR".
Negative amounts are also colored red by default. <a href="colors.html">This setting can be controlled, too.</a></p>
<p>A future version will add special settings for the format. However, current version depends on your language settings.</p>  
<p>This setting takes effect completely once you <a href="#restart">restarted the application.</a></p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>This setting controls the currency symbol that will be displayed. The default value is the currency derived from your
language setting.</p>
<p>This setting takes effect completely once you <a href="#restart">restarted the application.</a></p>

<h2 id="layout">Reset Layout Changes</h2>
<p>The application has a default layout for its size, position and order of views. As <em>RsBudget</em> remembers your
personal changes, there could be the situation that you are uncomfortable with the changes you made before. Tick the
box and the application will reset all your layout changes at next startup.</p>
<p>A layout reset also takes place when you <a href="../installation/update.html">update the application</a>.</p>

<h2 id="restart">Restart Application</h2>
<p>This link allows you to immediately save your changes in the Settings Dialog and restart the application. A confirmation
dialog will ensure that the restart does not occur because you clicked the link by accident.</p>
