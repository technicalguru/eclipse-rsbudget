<h1>Rules Settings</h1>
<p>This tab controls how <em>RsBudget</em> assists you while creating transactions. It defines
matching rules and whether to apply them or not.</p>

<h2 id="assignment">Automatic Assignments</h2>
<p>Mark the type of automatic assignments to be made. <em>RsBudget</em> will assign categories and budgets according to the
defined rules (see sections below). This assignment will be done when you <b>create</b> a transaction and first enter
a text for the transaction. Further modifications of the transaction will not trigger your rules again. This allows you 
to modify assignments after the rules engine made its work for a transaction.</p>

<h2 id="categories">Category Matching Rules</h2>
<p>The table lists all rules that will be applied in order of processing. The first matching rule will be applied and
following rules will be ignored. You can change this order by right-clicking on the table and selecting "Move Up"
or "Move Down". The menu also offers you the possibility to either create a new rule or to delete the rule currently
selected.</p>
<p>Double-click the table record to modify it. The "Matching Expression" is a string that the transaction text must
contain so that the rule applies. An applied rule will assign the category in column "Category" to the transaction.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> The screenshot above will assign category "Food" when a transaction lists "Grocery Store" in its text.</p> 

<h2 id="budgets">Budget Matching Rules</h2>
<p>The table lists all rules that will be applied in order of processing. The first matching rule will be applied and
following rules will be ignored. You can change this order by right-clicking on the table and selecting "Move Up"
or "Move Down". The menu also offers you the possibility to either create a new rule or to delete the rule currently
selected.</p>
<p>Double-click the table record to modify it. The "Matching Expression" is a string that the transaction text must
contain so that the rule applies. An applied rule will assign the budget in column "Budget" to the transaction.</p>
