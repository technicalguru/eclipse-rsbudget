<h1>Data Security</h1>
<p><em>RsBudget</em> respects the privacy of your personal data. Therefore, no personal data will will be transmitted to any other
computer. The anonymous update procedure is not triggered automatically so that you control yourself when <em>RsBudget</em>
contacts the update server.</p>
<p>The application itself is protected by a personal password that is never stored anywhere on your disk. You can change
this password at any time and as often as you like.</p>
<p>All your personal data is stored in a database on your computer (unless you configured the database to be on a remote PC). 
You can control yourself whether this data will be encrypted or not. Unless someone steals the database authentication information
from you or otherwise have access to your database, it is safe there and cannot be viewed.</p>
<p>You should be aware that - like all PC software - your data is as safe only as you protect your PC. Here are a few hints
how to protect your PC and your data:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be cautious when visiting unknown websites as they could infect your PC with Malware or a virus. Anti-Virus software is
not a 100 percent protection because:<ul>
		<li>It might not know the Malware or virus you are infected with.</li>
		<li>It is not updated regulary.</li>
		<li>It gives you a false sense of security which makes you less cautious.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Deactivate the automatic image display in your e-mail program.</li>
	<li>Never click on links in e-mails from unknown senders (or even from known senders unless you know what you are doing).</li>
	<li>Be cautious when plugging in a USB stick or USB drive. Deactivate the auto-start function on your PC.</li>
	<li>Use passwords only once. Attackers will not be able to use a stolen password somewhere else (Create such passwords by using an
	    easy-to-remember but hard-to-guess pattern).</li>
	<li>Be cautious when typing a password somewhere so nobody can observe you.</li>
	<li>Do not install unknown software. Research about the credibility before installing it.</li>
	<li>Do not write down your passwords anywhere, neither on paper nor in electronic files.</li>
</ul>
